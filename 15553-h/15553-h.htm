<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.<a name="Page_-12" id="Page_-12"></a></h2>


<p>The numerous collections of American verse share, I think, one fault in
common: they include too much. Whether this has been a bid for
popularity, a concession to Philistia, I cannot say; but the fact
remains that all anthologies of American poetry are, so far as I know,
more or less uncritical. The aim of the present book is different. In no
case has a poem been included because it is widely known. The purpose of
this compilation is solely that of preserving, in attractive and
permanent form, about one hundred and fifty of the best lyrics of
America.</p>

<p>I am quite aware of the danger attending such exacting honor-rolls. At
best, an editor's judgment is only personal, and the realization of this
fact gives me no small diffidence in attempting to decide what American
lyrics are best worthy of preservation. That every reader of the
"American Treasury" will find some favorite poem omitted, there can be
little doubt. But the effort made in this book towards a careful<a name="Page_-11" id="Page_-11"></a>
estimate of our lyrical poetry is at any rate, I feel sure, in a good
direction.</p>

<p>There appear in the index of Mr. Stedman's "Poets of America" the names
of over three hundred native writers. American verse in the last half
century has been extraordinarily prolific. It would seem that the time
has come, in the course of our national literature, for proving all
things and holding fast that which is good.</p>

<p>The fact that the title of this compilation instantly calls to mind that
of Mr. Palgrave's scholarly collection of English lyrics need not prove
a disadvantage to the book if the purpose which led to the choice of
name is understood. The verse of a single century produced in a new
country should not be expected to equal the poetic wealth of an old and
intellectual nation. But if American poetry cannot hope to rival the
poetry of the mother country, it may at least be compared with it; and
the fact of such a comparative point of view will aid rather than hinder
the student of our native poetry in estimating its value.</p>

<p>American verse has suffered at the hands both of its admirers and its
enemies. Injudicious praise, no less than supercilious contempt, has
reacted unfavorably on the fame of our poets. Again and again has some
minor versifier been hailed as the "American Keats" or the "American
Burns." Really excellent poets, though distinctly poets of second rank,<a name="Page_-10" id="Page_-10"></a>
have been elevated amid the blare of critical trumpets to the company of
Wordsworth and Milton. All this is unprofitable and silly. But not much
better is the attitude of certain critics who patronize everything in
the English language which has been written outside of England. Though
America has added&mdash;leaving Poe out of account&mdash;no distinctly new notes
to English poetry, it has added certainly not a few true ones. A nation
need never apologize for its literature when it has produced such
lyrics&mdash;to go no further&mdash;as "On a Bust of Dante," "Ichabod," "The
Chambered Nautilus," and the "Waterfowl."</p>

<p>My method of arrangement is roughly chronological. The First Book, which
is shorter than the others, might be called the book of Bryant; the
Second, of Longfellow; and the Third, of Aldrich. Since the periods must
of course overlap, this division of the poems can be at most only
suggestive.</p>

<p>I have made it no part of my design to grant to the better known poets a
larger number of lyrics than those given later and younger men. I have
paid no regard to that purely conventional idea of proportion, that
would assign to five or six writers a dozen selections each, and to
another set of poets, in proportion to their popular fame, half that
number. We can safely leave the final adjustment of all <a name="Page_-9" id="Page_-9"></a>rival claims to
Time, the best critic; in the meanwhile having the more modest aim of
selecting, irrespective of contemporary judgments, whatever is best
suited to our purpose.</p>

<p>A word more should be said about the title. I have not interpreted the
term lyric so rigidly as to exclude sonnets, ballads, elegiac verse, or
even pieces of almost pure description. If I had held to the strictest
sense of lyric, this book would never have been compiled; for I suspect
nothing will strike the reader more forcibly than the fact that, despite
the excellence of the poems included, there is a notable lack of
unconsciousness&mdash;of pure singing quality. Such things as Pinkney's
"Health" and Holmes's "Old Ironsides" are the exception. The poems are
composed cleverly, but they do not quite sing themselves to their own
music. The best American verse, while not insincere, is seldom wholly
spontaneous. This is not saying that much spontaneous verse has not been
written in this country; much has been, but the singer's voice has too
often been uncultivated, and the product inartistic.</p>

<p>The names of many popular poets are entirely omitted. In no case,
however, was this probably due to oversight. I have gone over carefully
a wide field of verse, not without finding much to admire, but never
quite happening upon that final touch of successful achievement where
art and inspiration join. <a name="Page_-8" id="Page_-8"></a>I am especially sorry to leave unrepresented
a writer&mdash;more imaginative, possibly, than any American poet except
Poe&mdash;whose utter contempt for technique in the ordinary sense places him
wholly outside my present purpose.</p>

<p>I wish to acknowledge various favors kindly shown by Professor C.T.
Winchester, Professor Barrett Wendell, and Mr. H.E. Scudder. Thanks are
also due Mr. T.B. Aldrich for the privilege of including the six poems
from his pen, which were kindly selected for the book by the poet
himself. The following firms deserve thanks for permitting the use of
copyrighted poems:</p>

<span>So that her highborn kinsmen came<br /></span>

<span>That the wind came out of the cloud by night,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br /></span>
<span>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br /></span>
<span>As of some one gently rapping&mdash;rapping at my chamber door.<br /></span>
<span>"'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Only this, and nothing more."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,<br /></span>
<span>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br /></span>
<span>Eagerly I wished the morrow;&mdash;vainly I had sought to borrow<br /></span>
<span>From my books surcease of sorrow&mdash;sorrow for the lost Lenore,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Nameless here forevermore.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>
<span>And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br /></span>
<span>Thrilled me&mdash;filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br /></span>
<span>So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating<br /></span>
<span>"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door,<br /></span>
<span>&mdash;Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">This it is, and nothing more."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br /></span>
<span>"Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br /></span>
<span>But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br /></span>
<span>And so faintly you came tapping&mdash;tapping at my chamber door,<br /></span>
<span>That I scarce was sure I heard you;"&mdash;here I opened wide the door:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Darkness there, and nothing more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;<br /></span>
<span>But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,<br /></span>
<span>And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore?"<br /></span>
<span>This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore:"<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Merely this, and nothing more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br /></span>
<span>Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.<br /></span>
<span>"Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice;<br /></span>
<span>Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">'Tis the wind, and nothing more."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br /></span>
<span>In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;<br /></span>
<span>But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Perched, and sat, and nothing more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling<br /></span>
<span>By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br /></span>
<span>"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,<br /></span>
<span>Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Tell, me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br /></span>
<span>Though its answer little meaning&mdash;little relevancy bore;<br /></span>
<span>For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With such name as "Nevermore."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only<br /></span>
<span>That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<br /></span>
<span>Nothing further then he uttered&mdash;not a feather then he fluttered&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Till I scarcely more than muttered, "Other friends have flown before&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>On the morrow <i>he</i> will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Then the bird said, "Nevermore."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br /></span>
<span>"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,<br /></span>
<span>Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster<br /></span>
<span>Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore,<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Of 'Never&mdash;nevermore.'"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,<br /></span>
<span>Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;<br /></span>
<span>Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br /></span>
<span>Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Meant in croaking "Nevermore."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br /></span>
<span>To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;<br /></span>
<span>This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br /></span>
<span>On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,<br /></span>
<span>But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>She</i> shall press, ah, nevermore!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>
<span>Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br /></span>
<span>Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.<br /></span>
<span>"Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee&mdash;by these angels He hath sent thee<br /></span>
<span>Respite&mdash;respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!<br /></span>
<span>Quaff, oh, quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!"<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!&mdash;prophet still, if bird or devil!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,<br /></span>
<span>Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>On this home by Horror haunted&mdash;tell me truly, I implore,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Is there,&mdash;<i>is</i> there balm in Gilead?&mdash;tell me&mdash;tell me, I implore!"<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!&mdash;prophet still, if bird or devil!<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>By that Heaven that bends above us&mdash;by that God we both adore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,<br /></span>
<span>It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I shrieked, upstarting,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!<br /></span>
<span>Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!<br /></span>
<span>Leave my loneliness unbroken!&mdash;quit the bust above my door!<br /></span>
<span>Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting<br /></span>
<span>On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,<br /></span>
<span>And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;<br /></span>
<span>And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Shall be lifted,&mdash;nevermore!<br /></span>

<span>The purple petals, fallen in the pool,<br /></span>

<span>Then Beauty is its own excuse for being:<br /></span>

<span>O marvel, fruit of fruits, I pause<br /></span>
<span>To reckon thee. I ask what cause<br /></span>
<span>Set free so much of red from heats<br /></span>
<span>At core of earth, and mixed such sweets<br /></span>
<span>With sour and spice: what was that strength<br /></span>
<span>Which out of darkness, length by length,<br /></span>
<span>Spun all thy shining thread of vine,<br /></span>
<span>Netting the fields in bond as thine.<br /></span>
<span>I see thy tendrils drink by sips<br /></span>
<span>From grass and clover's smiling lips;<br /></span>
<span>I hear thy roots dig down for wells,<br /></span>
<span>Tapping the meadow's hidden cells;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Whole generations of green things,<br /></span>
<span>Descended from long lines of springs,<br /></span>
<span>I see make room for thee to bide<br /></span>
<span>A quiet comrade by their side;<br /></span>
<span>I see the creeping peoples go<br /></span>
<span>Mysterious journeys to and fro,<br /></span>
<span>Treading to right and left of thee,<br /></span>
<span>Doing thee homage wonderingly.<br /></span>
<span>I see the wild bees as they fare,<br /></span>
<span>Thy cups of honey drink, but spare.<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>I mark thee bathe and bathe again<br /></span>
<span>In sweet uncalendared spring rain.<br /></span>
<span>I watch how all May has of sun<br /></span>
<span>Makes haste to have thy ripeness done,<br /></span>
<span>While all her nights let dews escape<br /></span>
<span>To set and cool thy perfect shape.<br /></span>
<span>Ah, fruit of fruits, no more I pause<br /></span>
<span>To dream and seek thy hidden laws!<br /></span>
<span>I stretch my hand and dare to taste,<br /></span>
<span>In instant of delicious waste<br /></span>
<span>On single feast, all things that went<br /></span>
<span>To make the empire thou hast spent.<br /></span>

<h2><a name="NOTES" id="NOTES"></a><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a>NOTES.</h2>


<p>American poetry before Bryant was considerable in amount, but, with few
exceptions, it must be looked for by the curious student in the
graveyard of old anthologies. Who now reads "The Simple Cobbler of
Agawam in America," "The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung up in America," "The
Day of Doom," "M'Fingal," or "The Columbiad?" Skipping a generation from
Barlow's death, who reads with much seriousness any one of the group of
poets of which Bryant in his earliest period was the centre: Halleck,
Pierpont, Sprague, Drake, Dana, Percival, Allston, Brainard, Mrs.
Osgood, and Miss Brooks? A few of them, to be sure, are remembered by an
occasional lyric,&mdash;Halleck by "Marco Bozzaris," a spirited ode in the
manner of Campbell; Pierpont by his ringing lines, "Warren's Address to
the American Soldiers;" Drake by "The American Flag," conventional but
not commonplace, and marked by one very imaginative line; and Allston by
two rather excellent lyrics, "Rosalie" and "America to Great Britain."
The first poet to accomplish work of high sustained excellence was
Bryant. His poetry, though never impassioned, is uniformly elegant. It
is often as chaste as Landor at his best. But it never surprises; it is
not <a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a>emotional, personal, suggestively imaginative. In fact, Bryant's
muse is not lyrical. With the exception of Pinkney and Hoffman, whose
"Sparkling and Bright," if technically defective, is a true song, we
must wait for our lyric poet till we reach Edgar Allan Poe, the
greatest&mdash;one inclines to say the only&mdash;master of musical quality in
verse whom America has produced.</p>

<p><i>The Wild Honeysuckle.</i>&mdash;Philip Freneau, born in 1752, was a soldier in
the American Revolution. Though never rising quite into the highest
class of poets, he is our first genuine singer. "The Indian
Burying-ground" and "To a Honey-bee" are only less successful than the
graceful lines quoted.</p>

<p><i>A Health.</i>&mdash;Poe was an enthusiastic admirer of this poem. He pronounced
it, in his essay entitled "The Poetic Principle," "full of brilliancy
and spirit," and added: "It was the misfortune of Mr. Pinkney to have
been born too far south. Had he been a New Englander, it is probable
that he would have been ranked as the first of American lyrists by that
magnanimous cabal which has so long controlled the destinies of American
Letters, in conducting the thing called <i>The North American Review</i>."
This passage, very characteristic of Poe's criticisms, illustrates both
his championship of favorites, and unmerciful scourging of foes.</p>

<p><i>Unseen Spirits.</i>&mdash;The earnest sincerity, evident in every line of this
poem, removes it at once from the company of those gay society verses
sparkling with conceits which won for Willis the satiric comment of
Lowell in "A Fable for Critics:"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a>
<span>"There is Willis, all natty, and jaunty, and gay,<br /></span>
<span>Who says his best things in so foppish a way,<br /></span>
<span>With conceits and pet phrases so thickly o'erlaying 'em,<br /></span>
<span>That one hardly knows whether to thank him for saying 'em;<br /></span>
<span>Over-ornament ruins both poem and prose,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Just conceive of a Muse with a ring in her nose!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Had Willis written more such lyrics as "Unseen Spirits," his fame could
hardly have proved so ephemeral. Poe considered this poem Willis's best,
and I see no ground for calling the critic's judgment in question.</p>

<p><i>To Helen.</i>&mdash;This brief lyric, written in the poet's youth, is not only
among the most exquisite from his pen, but it furnishes one of the most
famous among current quotations:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>"The glory that was Greece,<br /></span>
<span>And the grandeur that was Rome."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>On the Death of Joseph Rodman Drake.</i>&mdash;These manly lines have yielded
another phrase to the world's memory. Hardly any quotation is more
hackneyed than the last two verses of the first stanza. Drake was a
young poet, the intimate friend and literary co-laborer of Halleck, who
died September, 1820, in his twenty-fifth year.</p>

<p><i>To the Fringed Gentian.</i>&mdash;This lyric well illustrates what Mr. Stedman
has aptly termed Bryant's "Doric simplicity." Nothing of Wordsworth's is
freer from ornament or from the least trace of affectation.</p>

<p><i>The Raven.</i>&mdash;Though not belonging to the highest order of poetry, "The
Raven" still maintains its position <a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a>at the head of its class. No more
astonishing <i>tour de force</i> can be found in English literature.</p>

<p><i>Nature.</i>&mdash;Generally regarded, I think, the finest of Longfellow's, if
not of American, sonnets.</p>

<p><i>Ichabod.</i>&mdash;Occasioned by the defection and fall of Daniel Webster. It
is worthy a place by the side of Browning's "Lost Leader." In later
years, Whittier wrote a poem on the theme, which, while not a retraction
of his former position, is penned in a tenderer, more tolerant mood,
"The Lost Occasion" is its title, and it is only just to the poet to
read this second lyric, hardly less successful, in connection with the
first.</p>

<p><i>Old Ironsides.</i>&mdash;"Old Ironsides" was the popular name for the frigate
<i>Constitution</i>. Dr. Holmes's poem appeared in the Boston <i>Advertiser</i>
"at the time when it was proposed to break up the old ship as unfit for
service."</p>

<p><i>Bedouin Song.</i>&mdash;One of the most spirited, most genuinely lyrical of
American poems.</p>

<p><i>Skipper Ireson's Ride.</i>&mdash;These lines have an easy, swinging quality
that is quite inimitable. One inclines to agree with Mr. Stedman: "Of
all our poets he (Whittier) is the most natural balladist."</p>

<p><i>The Village Blacksmith.</i>&mdash;The directness and homely strength of "The
Village Blacksmith" have made it deservedly popular. One questions
whether the last stanza might not have been omitted with advantage both
to the unity and force of the poem.</p>

<p><i>The Last Leaf.</i>&mdash;This masterpiece of mingled humor and pathos was a
favorite poem of Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a><i>The Old Kentucky Home.</i>&mdash;The sincere and tender sentiment of this
song, no less than its popular melody, has made it for many years a
favorite. Even better known is Foster's "Old Folks at Home," which is
said to have had a larger sale than any other American song.</p>

<p><i>Carolina.</i>&mdash;The concluding lines of this lyric have an imaginative
vigor rare in American poetry. Four stanzas are omitted.</p>

<p><i>Dirge for a Soldier.</i>&mdash;Boker's Dirge was written in memory of General
Philip Kearney.</p>

<p><i>Battle-hymn of the Republic.</i>&mdash;Written in December, 1861, while Mrs.
Howe was on a visit to Washington. Soon after the writer's return to
Boston the lines were accepted for publication in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>
by James T. Fields, who suggested the title of the poem. The song did
not at first receive much notice, but before the Civil War was over had
become very popular.</p>

<p><i>My Maryland.</i>&mdash;A poem of great strength and beauty, though of uneven
merit. It is unfortunately marred by a few rather intemperate
expressions. The sincerity of feeling is everywhere so evident, however,
that these must be forgiven. The lines were written by a native of
Baltimore, Prof. James Randall, and were first published in April, 1861.
The author of the famous song was teaching in a Louisiana college when
he read in a New Orleans paper the news of the attack on the
Massachusetts troops as they passed through Baltimore. This newspaper
account inspired the verses.</p>

<p><i>In the Hospital.</i>&mdash;This poem, which has enjoyed at <a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a>best a newspaper
immortality, deserves to be more widely known. Its simplicity,
directness, and truth of feeling are quite beyond praise. According to a
story which one dislikes to believe apocryphal, these lines were found
under the pillow of a wounded soldier near Port Royal, South Carolina,
in 1864.</p>

<p><i>Days.</i>&mdash;Regarded from the point of view of artistic form, perhaps
nothing of Emerson's is quite so flawless as "Days," a poem which for
conciseness and polish is worthy to be called classic.</p>

<p><i>A Death-bed.</i>&mdash;This is a worthy companion-piece to that other miniature
classic, Thomas Hood's song, beginning, "We watched her breathing
through the night."</p>

<p><i>Telling the Bees.</i>&mdash;"A remarkable custom, brought from the Old Country,
formerly prevailed in the rural districts of New England. On the death
of a member of the family, the bees were at once informed of the event,
and their hives dressed in mourning. The ceremonial was supposed to be
necessary to prevent the swarms from leaving their hives and seeking a
new home." This poem of Whittier's is almost his highest achievement.
Lowell said, in writing of the Quaker poet (Appleton's Cyclopedia of
American Biography, VI.): "Many of his poems (such for example as
'Telling the Bees'), in which description and sentiment mutually inspire
each other, are as fine as any in the language." I often think, however,
that Whittier will live longest by his hymns and poems of purely
religious devotion. I know of nothing similar in English that surpasses
"The Eternal Goodness," and perhaps half a dozen other poems.</p>

<p><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a><i>Katie.</i>&mdash;About one-third of Timrod's graceful poem which bears this
title. This is one of the few cases where I have ventured to make
omissions.</p>

<p><i>Thalatta.</i>&mdash;Regarding this poem, Thomas Wentworth Higginson says, in
"The New World and the New Book:" "Who knows but that, when all else of
American literature has vanished in forgetfulness, some single little
masterpiece like this may remain to show the high-water mark, not merely
of a single poet, but of a nation and a generation?" The author of
"Thalatta" was a Dartmouth graduate, a teacher, and a disciple of
Emerson.</p>

<p><i>The Fall of the Leaf.</i>&mdash;Thoreau's prose is known universally; his verse
has not won as yet the recognition it deserves. It has little lyrical
quality, but for unconventionality, charming turns of phrase, and the
intimate knowledge of Nature it reveals, it is almost alone in American
poetry.</p>

<p><i>The Rhodora.</i>&mdash;"The Rhodora" has a conciseness and unity too rare in
Emerson's poetry, which, beautiful in details, is strangely uneven. We
sigh as we think what an unrivalled lyric poet Emerson would have been
had he been sustained at the heights he was capable of reaching. No one
surpasses Emerson at his best; he is almost a great poet.</p>

<p><i>The Chambered Nautilus.</i>&mdash;Many think this Holmes's finest poem. It is
taken from "The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table," 1858.</p>

<p><i>Thought.</i>&mdash;Helen Jackson is, perhaps, the most gifted of American women
poets. Emily Dickinson is more <a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a>imaginative, but her utter scorn of form
in composition makes her work, unique as it is, less satisfying. Mrs.
Jackson was a favorite with Emerson, and he is said to have liked best
among her poems this sonnet, "Thought."</p>

<p><i>On a Bust of Dante.</i>&mdash;Parsons, one of the best of American poets, is
one of the most neglected. Stedman is inclined to think "On a Bust of
Dante" the finest of American lyrics (see "The Nature of Poetry," 254).</p>

<p><i>The Port of Skips.</i>&mdash;In a recent review of American Literature in the
London <i>Ath&aelig;neum</i> occurs this sentence: "In point of power, workmanship,
and feeling, among all poems written by Americans, we are inclined to
give first place to the 'Port of Ships,' of Joaquin Miller."</p>

<p><i>Evening Song.</i>&mdash;No poem of Lanier is more free from his characteristic
faults. One regrets that so much of his work, highly imaginative as it
is, is marred by over-elaboration and artificiality.</p>

<p><i>A Woman's Thought.</i>&mdash;The striking reality and directness of this lyric,
its immense emotional undercurrent, and its abrupt, almost gasping
metre, admirably suited to the impassioned mood of the speaker,&mdash;these
are a few of the qualities that combine to make "A Woman's Thought" one
of the most remarkable poems in the book.</p>

<p><i>The White Jessamine.</i>&mdash;One of the most charming of Father Tabb's
lyrics. The verse of this poet is uneven in merit. He is too prone to
merely fanciful conceits. But at his best Tabb is imaginative, as, for
example, in the lines where he says of Angelo that he&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a>
<span>"From the sterile womb of stone,<br /></span>
<span>Raised children unto God."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Always artistic, Tabb's verse usually suggests workmanship; it is more
thoughtful than spontaneous. His religious poetry presents, in the main,
a rather striking similarity to the work of George Herbert.</p>

<p><i>The Battle-field.</i>&mdash;Miss Dickinson has much of the witchcraft and
subtlety of William Blake. Many verses of the shy recluse, whom Mr.
Higginson so happily has introduced to the world, are not only daring
and unconventional, but recklessly defiant of form. But, as her editor
has well said, "When a thought takes one's breath away, a lesson on
grammar seems an impertinence." Emily Dickinson had more than a message,
more than the charm of unexpectedness, more than the gift of
phrase,&mdash;she had (and of how many Americans can this be said?) an
intense imagination.</p>

<p><i>Fertility.</i>&mdash;This selection appears in the collected poems of Maurice
Thompson (Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co., 1892), under the title of "A
Prelude."</p>

<p><i>Sesostris.</i>&mdash;Of this poem Mr. Stoddard has the high praise that in
imaginative quality it is unequalled in nineteenth century literature,
unless by Leigh Hunt's sonnet on the Nile. The same critic does not
scruple to declare of Mr. Mifflin that he has a "glorious imagination,"
and to prophesy for him a distinguished future. Seldom indeed has a
first book of verse won such instant and universal appreciation as Mr.
Mifflin's volume of sonnets, just issued as the "American Treasury" goes
to press.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
